  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>dvctvs conducts research in socio-technical and distributed systems with focus on digital identity. Whenever technologies scrutinise natural persons, developers need to take a stance. We provide the expertise and managerial capacity to lead projects, where attestation services are built.</p>
  <h2>We keep emerging technologies in check.</h2>
  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>dvctvs leads project management for decentralised identity projects that are building on distributed technology stacks, including W3C verifiable credentials, OpenID Connect for verifiable presentation and credential issuance, ERC-721 and ERC-6551, as well as PKI-based identity systems.</p>
  <h2>We strive for excellence.</h2>
